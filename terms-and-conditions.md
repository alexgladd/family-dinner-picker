# Family Dinner Picker Terms & Conditions

By downloading or using Family Dinner Picker (the App), these terms will automatically apply to you. You should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before downloading or using the App.

You’re not allowed to copy or modify the App or any part of the App in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the App, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the App into other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to me, Alex Gladd.

I am committed to ensuring that the App is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, I reserve the right to make changes to the App or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. I will never charge you for the App or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.

The App processes and stores personal data that you have provided to me in order to provide the services of the App. It’s your responsibility to keep your device and access to the App secure. I therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your device, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your device vulnerable to malicious software, compromise your device’s security features, and could mean that the App won’t work properly or at all.

The App uses third party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions. You can find links to Terms and Conditions of third party service providers used by the App below:

* [Google Play Services](https://policies.google.com/terms)
* [Google Analytics for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/terms/analytics)
* [Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics)

You should be aware that there are certain things that I will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the App will require the App to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but I cannot take responsibility for the App not working fully if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.

If you’re using the App outside of an area with Wi-Fi, your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the App, or other third party charges. In using the App, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the App outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the App, please be aware that I assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the App.

Along the same lines, I cannot always take responsibility for the way you use your device and the App. E.g., you need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to use the App, I cannot accept responsibility.

With respect to my responsibility for your use of the App, when you’re using the App, it’s important to bear in mind that although I endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, I do rely on third parties to provide information to me so that I can make it available to you. I accept no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on the functionality of the App.

At some point, I may wish to update the App. The app is currently available on Android & iOS (Google Play and the Apple App Store, respectively). The requirements for both systems (and for any additional systems I decide to extend the availability of the App to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the App. I do not promise that I will always update the App so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android or iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you agree to always accept updates to the App when offered to you. I may also wish to stop providing the App and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless I tell you otherwise, upon any termination: (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the App; and (c) if needed, delete it from your device.

## Changes to This Terms and Conditions

I may update these Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.

These terms and conditions are effective as of **06 April 2021**
